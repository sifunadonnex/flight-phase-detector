# ✈️ Flight Phase Detection System

A comprehensive Python tool for automatically detecting and analyzing flight phases from aircraft Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data.

---

## 📊 Overview

This system analyzes CSV files containing flight data parameters (airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, engine torque, etc.) and automatically identifies different phases of flight using a rule-based classification algorithm.

---

## 🛫 Flight Phases

### Standard Flight Phases

The system detects the following flight phases based on aviation standards:

| Phase | Description | Key Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **GROUND (Pre-Flight)** | Aircraft parked before flight | Airspeed = 0 knots, constant altitude |
| **TAXI-OUT** | Taxiing to runway | Airspeed 0–30 knots, low engine torque |
| **TAKEOFF** | Acceleration and liftoff | Airspeed 80–120 knots, max torque, high acceleration |
| **INITIAL CLIMB** | Climb after takeoff | Altitude up to ~1,500 ft AGL, high vertical speed |
| **CLIMB** | Climb to cruise | Altitude >1,500 ft AGL, positive vertical speed |
| **CRUISE** | Level flight | Constant altitude and airspeed, autopilot engaged |
| **DESCENT** | Controlled descent | Negative vertical speed, decreasing altitude |
| **APPROACH** | Final approach | Altitude <3,000 ft AGL, flaps and gear extended |
| **LANDING** | Touchdown and rollout | High deceleration, reverse thrust |
| **TAXI-IN** | Taxiing to gate | Airspeed 0–30 knots, low torque |
| **GROUND (Post-Flight)** | Aircraft parked after flight | Engines shutting down |

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Detection Algorithm

Uses a multi-parameter rule-based approach:

- **Primary Parameters**: Airspeed, Altitude (MSL & AGL), Vertical Speed, Autopilot status  
- **Secondary Parameters**: Engine torque, Flap position, Acceleration (normal, longitudinal, lateral), Time derivatives

#### Detection Thresholds (Configurable)

```python
THRESHOLDS = {
    'taxi_speed': 30,
    'takeoff_speed': 80,
    'rotation_speed': 100,
    'climb_rate': 500,
    'descent_rate': -300,
    'cruise_vs_threshold': 200,
    'approach_altitude': 3000,
    'initial_climb_alt': 1500,
}
```

## 🧹 Data Processing

1. Data cleaning and outlier handling  
2. Smoothing with rolling averages  
3. Derivative calculations (e.g., vertical speed)  
4. Phase smoothing to reduce noise  
5. Ground reference detection
