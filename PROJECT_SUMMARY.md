- ✅ Derived parameter calculation (vertical speed, AGL altitude)
- ✅ Signal smoothing to handle sensor noise
- ✅ Phase transition smoothing (eliminates spurious detections)
- ✅ Configurable thresholds for different aircraft types

### Comprehensive Output
- ✅ Detailed CSV with phase for every data point
- ✅ Summary statistics for each phase segment
- ✅ Text reports with aviation-standard metrics
- ✅ Professional visualizations

### Aviation Standards Compliance
- ✅ Follows ICAO, FAA, EASA definitions
- ✅ Uses standard aviation terminology
- ✅ Includes safety-critical phases
- ✅ Suitable for Flight Data Monitoring (FDM)

## Research Conducted

### Flight Phases
Comprehensive research on 11 standard flight phases including:
- Detailed characteristics (airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, etc.)
- Typical duration for each phase
- Safety considerations and risk factors
- Detection parameters and thresholds

### Aviation Standards
- **ICAO Annex 6**: Operation of Aircraft
- **FAA AC 120-82**: Flight Operational Quality Assurance
- **EASA AMC/GM**: Flight Data Monitoring requirements
- **IATA**: Flight Data Analysis best practices

### Safety Analysis
- Accident statistics by flight phase
- Critical phases identification
- Event detection requirements

### Technical Parameters
- Primary parameters (airspeed, altitude, vertical speed)
- Secondary parameters (engine torque, autopilot, flaps)
- Sensor characteristics and accuracy
- Data sampling rates

## How It Works

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Data Loading**
   - Reads CSV file
   - Handles column name variations
   - Skips unit rows

2. **Derived Parameters**
   - Averages left/right sensors (airspeed, altitude)
   - Calculates vertical speed from altitude change
   - Smooths noisy signals
   - Determines ground altitude reference
   - Calculates altitude AGL

3. **Phase Classification**
   - Rule-based classification for each sample
   - Considers multiple parameters simultaneously
   - Example rules:
     - Ground: airspeed < 5 kts AND altitude_agl < 500 ft
     - Climb: vertical_speed > 500 fpm AND altitude_agl > 1500 ft
     - Cruise: |vertical_speed| < 200 fpm AND altitude_agl > 3000 ft

4. **Post-Processing**
   - Smooths phase transitions
   - Eliminates short-duration spurious phases
   - Merges adjacent similar phases

5. **Output Generation**
   - Extracts phase segments
   - Calculates statistics for each segment
   - Generates multiple output formats
